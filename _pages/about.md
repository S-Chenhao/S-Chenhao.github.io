I am a second-year PhD student at the [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-SZ)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/zh-hans), specializing in AI4Sci and Physics-Informed Machine Learning under the supervision of [Prof. Yan Ming](https://mingyan08.github.io/). My academic journey began with a double major in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Connecticut (Uconn), and pursued a Master of Mathematics at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University(NYU).
